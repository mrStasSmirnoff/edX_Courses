Key Point (Functions)

- Logical functions (ISNUMERIC, IIF, CHOOSE etc.) return Boolean values (true or false) based on an expression or column value.
- Scalar functions return a single value based on zero or more input parameters.
- Window functions are used to rank rows across partitions or "windows". Window functions include RANK, DENSE_RANK, NTILE, and ROW_NUMBER.
- Aggregate functions are used to provide summary values for mulitple rows - for example, the total cost of products or the maximum number of items in an order. Commonly used aggregate functions include SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, and AVG.

Key Points (GROUPING AGGREGATED DATA and FILTERING IT)

- You can use GROUP BY with aggregate functions to return aggregations grouped by one or more columns or expressions.
- All columns in the SELECT clause that are not aggregate function expressions must be included in a GROUP BY clause.
- The order in which columns or expressions are listed in the GROUP BY clause determines the grouping hierarchy.
- You can filter the groups that are included in the query results by specifying a HAVING clause.
