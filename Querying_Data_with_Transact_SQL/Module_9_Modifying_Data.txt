Key Points (INSERTING)

- Use the INSERT statement to insert one or more rows into a table.
- When inserting explicit values, you can omit identity columns, columns that allow NULLs, and columns on which a default constraint is defined.
- Identity columns generate a unique integer identifier for each row. You can also use a sequence to generate unique values that can be used in multiple tables.


Key Points (UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE)
- Use the UPDATE statement to modify the values of one or more columns in specified rows of a table.
- Use the DELETE statement to delete specified rows in a table.
- Use the MERGE statement to insert, update, and delete rows in a target table based on data in a source table.
