Key Points:

- Transact-SQL is the language used to query data in Microsoft SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.
- Data is stored in tables, which may be related to one another through common key fields.
- Objects in a database are organized into schemas.
- The fully qualified naming syntax for an object is server_name.database_name.schema_name.object_name, but in most cases you can abbreviate this to schema_name.object_name.


Key Points:

- Use the SELECT statement to retrieve a rowset of data from tables and views in a database.
- SELECT statements are written with the following clauses: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY. However, the query engine processes the clauses in this order: FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, SELECT, ORDER BY.
- In the SELECT clause, you can use * to return all columns, but generally you should specify explicit columns.
- You can specify expressions in the SELECT clause to return the results of calculations.
- You can use the AS keyword to specify aliases for columns in the rowset returned by the SELECT statement.

Key Points:

- Transact-SQL supports a wide range of data types, which can be broadly categorized as exact numeric, approximate numeric, character, date/time, binary, and other 
(which includes specialized data types for handling data such as XML and spatial data).

- Some data types are compatible, and values can be implicitly converted between them. Conversion between other data types requires the use of explicit conversion functions.


Key Points:

- NULL is used to indicate an unknown or missing value. NULL is not equivalent to zero or an empty string.
- Arithmetic or string concatenation operations involving one or more NULL operands return NULL. For example, 12 + NULL = NULL.
- If you need to compare a value to NULL, use the IS operator instead of the = operator. 
- The ISNULL function returns a specified alternative value for NULL columns and variables.
- The NULLIF function returns NULL when a column or variable contains a specified value.
- The COALESCE function returns the first non-NULL value in a specified list of columns or variables).
