/*Retrieving Transportation Report Data
The logistics manager at AdventureWorks has asked you to generate some reports containing details of the company's customers to help reduce transportation costs. For starters, you need to produce a list of all of your customers' locations.
Finish the Transact-SQL query that retrieves all values for City and StateProvince, without duplicates, from the Address table.

Modify your previous query to retrieve the product number, name, and list price of products with product number beginning with 'BK-' followed by any character other than 'R', and ending with a '-' followed by any two numerals.
Remember:
	• to match any string of zero or more characters, use %

	• to match a numeral, use [0-9]
